### Dashboard Preview
### Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Paid Search Campaign for a shopping mall in the United States. The analysis covers a 5-month period in 2021, with the primary objectives of optimizing conversions, increasing profitability, and reducing costs.

### Introduction
A Paid Search Marketing Campaign is a digital advertising strategy designed to promote products or services through search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. It operates on a pay-per-click (PPC) model, where advertisers bid on specific keywords to ensure their ads appear prominently in search results when users search for related terms. These campaigns are highly effective because they target potential customers based on their search intent, increasing the likelihood of conversions.

### Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the performance of a paid search campaign over the past five months and optimize it to maximize conversions and revenue while minimizing costs. The analysis focuses on achieving three key objectives:

- <b>Maximize Conversions: </b> The goal is to increase the campaign’s ability to convert potential prospects into actual customers. By analyzing conversion rates and paths from impressions, and clicks to conversions, we’ll identify campaigns from ad groups that are successful from a conversion standpoint so that they can be recommended to marketing managers for optimization.44
- <b>Increase Profits: </b> Another important goal is to increase the impact of campaigns on the profitability of shopping malls. By examining metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) and Profit Loss, we can uncover insights about which ad groups and keywords are generating the most revenue. This information enables data-driven decisions to allocate resources effectively and invest in the areas that generate the highest returns.
- <b>Minimize Cost: </b> The third goal focuses on optimizing costs. By evaluating metrics such as Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Conversion, we aim to identify areas where costs can be reduced without sacrificing campaign performance. This approach ensures that marketing budgets are allocated efficiently, resulting in higher ROI and increased profitability.

### Data Dictionary

- <b>Month:</b> The month during which the campaign was active. The campaign ran from July 2021 to November 2021.
